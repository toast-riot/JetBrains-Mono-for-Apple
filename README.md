# JetBrains Mono for Apple
This is a configuration profile for iOS / iPadOS that includes the entire JetBrain Mono font and all its variations (italic, bold, thin, ect.). This was made so you donâ€™t have to install each of the 32 fonts separately through some half-gigabyte ad-infested font app. Also includes the code I used to make it.
